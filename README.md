This is a guessing game about me required as part of Lab 02, course 201

I started the project with writing a brief summary about me and then creating 5 prompt questions to challenge the user to guess whether they were correct. 

In addition, I will be challenging the user to get to know me further by listing some of my favorite books, and then asking additional questions while restricting the number of attempts they have with each of these questions. 

I will then display the final score the user would have received at the end of the game. 

November 2 - Vij was the navigator and Beth Hansen was the driver

Nov 6 - I tried to do the stretch goals and use the arrays and loop to get questions 1-5.  When I used Repl it was awkard since I couldnt use the prompt and alerts to figure out the bugs.  And commenting out the old code to make a completely new one, seemed intuitive but it was hard to trouble shoot when I uncommented aspects of the code.  

So at first when I submitted my deplyed site, i had my entire code with arrays commented out and made sure the original code worked.

And then to really try my idea with the arrays, and functions within an array and array within an array, it was simpler to make a completely new app2.js file and work in it and systematically debug.  

I am currently using that in my updated site.  But I didnt have the heart to delete my old code in app.js.

I am happy to combine the app2.js contents into app.js and comment out the entire current code in app.js, but it looks so messy.
