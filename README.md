# About_Me_Guessing_Game
This is a guessing game about me required as part of Lab 02, course 201

I started the project with writing a brief summary about me and then creating 5 prompt questions to challenge the user to guess whether they were correct. 

In addition, I will be challenging the user to get to know me further by listing some of my favorite books, and then asking additional questions while restricting the number of attempts they have with each of these questions. 

I will then display the final score the user would have received at the end of the game.
