      <br />

      I have lived in total four different countries including USA. They are India, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand. <br />
      <br />


      I was born in India but lived there for a short time. I spent my childhood in Saudi Arabia and my college years in
      New Zealand. I moved to California first and made Seattle my home in last 7 years.<br />
      <br />


      I love working with kids and being around kids. I live with my husband. We have two kids and a 10year old dog.
      We adopted our dog first in California and then had two kids in Seattle.<br />
      <br />


      I did my medical training in New Zealand and my Pediatric residency in California. I did further studying in
      University of Washington, Seattle, before starting my first job here in Seattle.<br />
      <br />


      I decided to take time off this year to spend time with my family and learn a new skill. I enjoy working with
      computers and enjoy medicine. But <em>seriously</em> technology use can be improved so much more in healthcare. By
      learning technical skills including coding, I hope to develop apps that I can use in healthcare and make life
      easier for my colleagues. <br />
      <br />


      My other passion is volunteering at the local temple and teaching our kids our culture and different languages. I
      speak 3 languages spoken in India, can read/write Arabic, Hindi, Gujarati along with English. Both my kids learn
      French and I hope to learn from them eventually. <br />
